# The Cartel's Research Task Force (CRTF)

CRTF is a decentralised ventured backed cult birthed by the MetaCartel. We are a dark society that practices the shadow arts of cryptoeconomic mechanism design. We are based around the world from bases in the undergrowths of the favelas to the green and gold of the glorious australia. We are coming. We do not forget. We do not remember. We are the CRTF and we don't give a shit.

## Main activity

We are working on meta-txs and focusing on decentralising the centralised server aspect of the architecture. This involves problem solving across these fields... If you don't know what meta-txs are, start here: [Introduction to Meta-txs](https://github.com/Meta-tx/Harbour-MVP/wiki)

- Cryptoeconomic design
- Distributed p2p networking
